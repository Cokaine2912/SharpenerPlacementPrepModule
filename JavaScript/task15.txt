Answer 1 : JOINS are used to combine two or more more table based on some related common column between the tables


    Left Join - Returns all the data from the left table even if there are no matches in the right table 
    Right Join - Returns all the data from the right table even if there are no matches in the left table
    Inner Join - Returns only those rows where there are matches in both the tables
    Full Outer Join - Returns rows where there is match in one of the tables 


Answer 2 :

SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_date

FROM orders

INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;


Answer 3 : 

    PRIMARY KEY - unique value and unique identifier of the row.
	
    FOREIGN KEY - to establish a connection between two tables by referencing the primary key of one table into another table
	
    UNIQUE - this is to restrict repetition of values in a particular column
	
    CHECK - to allow only that insertion which follows a desired condition 
	
    NOT NULL - while insertion this parameter or column should be always be specified and could not be empty
	
Answer 4 : 

	UNIQUE constraint to a column means that no duplicate values are allowed and all the values should be different from each other
	
Answer 5 : 
	
	PRIMARY key serves as a uinique identifier of a row in the table
	
	FOREIGN key serves as a reference to the to a row from another table
	
	Suppose we have two tables Customers and Orders
	
	Customers :
			id - PRIMARY key to uniquely identify a customer
			name -
			address - 
			mobile - 
			email - 
	Orders : 
			id - PRIMARY key to uniquely identify an order 
			product - 
			quantity - 
			customer_id - FOREIGN key this refers to a customer in the Customers table to whom the order belongs
			
Answer 6 : 
	
	PRIMARY and UNIQUE constraints both ensure uniqueness but the primary key typically serves as the main identifier
	PRIMARY key is only one in whole table but UNIQUE constraint can be applied to multiple columns in the table 
	PRIMARY key of one table serves as a FOREIGN key in the anoter but not any column with UNIQUE constraint
